 * In NVIDIA's implementation of SPDM, we will support application messages
 * which are payloads delivered encrypted in SPDM secured messages,
 * sent across the SPDM channel, but do not contain SPDM messages.
 * Instead, these messages are for NVIDIA-application purposes.
 * These messages and relevant structs are defined here.
 */

/* ------------------------- Application Payloads ------------------------ */
/*!
 * All application messages will follow a simple header format in order to
 * simplify the parsing and forwarding of application messages to the
 * relevant recipient endpoint. This format is defined as follows:
 *
 * +----------------------------------+
 * |          RM_SPDM_NV_CMD          |
 * | Command Type |  Command Payload  |
 * |  (4 bytes)     (n - 4 - 4 bytes) |
 * +----------------------------------+
 *
 * The Command Type value defines the expected structure of the payload,
 * and how it should be interpreted.
 *
 * There are two major categories of commands - requests and responses.
 * The values of 0x00000000-0x7FFFFFFF are reserved for requests.
 * The values of 0x80000000-0xFFFFFFFF are reserved for responses.
